                    <h2>The Man</h2>
                    <p>Project Runway season 20 winner Bishme Cromatie; Jane Wade, the Pacific-Northwestern who examines the intersection of the corporate and utilitarian in her work and presented off-calendar last September; and the Kazakhstan-born designer Meruert Tolegen.</p>

                    <h2>Stylish</h2>
                    <p>With every New York Fashion Week comes a crop of fresh talents, be they new-ish names who’ve just made the official calendar or younglings who’ve chosen this moment for their debuts. On this season’s list is Colleen Allen, a former Vogue assistant who cut her teeth at Raf Simons’s Calvin Klein and The Row.</p>

                    <h2>Swanning Around</h2>
                    <p> The schedule officially kicks off this Friday, February 9, with Peter Do’s sophomore outing at Helmut Lang, and Vogue Runway will review close to 100 collections before Thom Browne caps things off on Valentine’s Day. (Pressing question: will we get boxes of chocolate, like we did last year?) But the goings-on start tomorrow with a 40th anniversary screening of Sophie’s Choice hosted by Lanvin, which is supposed to be announcing its new creative director any day.</p>

                    <p> “Women Dressing Women” and “Mood of the Moment: Gaby Aghion and the House of Chloé” are respectively on view at the Costume Institute and The Jewish Museum. Also worth a visit, with 1980s proportions on the upswing, is the Museum at FIT’s “Statement Sleeves” show.</p>

                    <h2>Now on View</h2>
                    <p>Getting a jumpstart on the festivities, Marc Jacobs gave his 40th anniversary show a name, Wonder, and delivered on multiple fronts, from the swans-on-psychedelics wigs and curvy-heeled doll shoes to the shape-shifting clothes. Fashion is cyclical; you’re up, you’re down, in and out. That the job still brings Jacobs joy, and that he shares it with us so dependably in return?</p>
